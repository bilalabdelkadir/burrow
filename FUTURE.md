# Future

Planned features for Burrow.

1. **Dashboard** — Web UI for monitoring tunnels, connections, and traffic in real time.
2. **Subdomain assignment** — Each user gets a persistent, free subdomain (e.g., `user123.burrow.dev`) that routes to their tunnel.
3. **Long-lived connections** — Persistent tunnel connections with automatic reconnection and keepalive heartbeats.
4. **Rate limiting** — Per-user and per-tunnel request rate limits to prevent abuse.
5. **Multi-tenant** — Isolated tenants sharing the same server infrastructure with resource and routing separation.
6. **Teams** — Team accounts, shared tunnels, and role-based access control.
7. **Simple self-deploy commands** — One-command self-hosting setup for running your own Burrow server.
8. **Docker** — Official Docker images and docker-compose files for easy deployment.
9. **Prometheus** — Metrics export for monitoring (request counts, latency, errors, active tunnels).
10. **Grafana** — Pre-built dashboards for visualizing Prometheus metrics out of the box.
